## Introduction

hummingbird is a package for identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between case and
control groups using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) or reduced representative bisulfite
sequencing (RRBS) experiment data.

The hummingbird package uses a Bayesian hidden Markov model (HMM) for detecting DMRs. It fits a 
Bayesian HMM for each chromosome. The final output of hummingbird is the DMRs with start and end 
position in a given chromosome, directions of the DMRs (hyper- or hypo-), and the number of CpGs 
in the DMRs. 

## Functions

The hummingbird package contains the following three functions: 

(1) hummingbirdEM: Reads the input data, sets the initial values, executes the Expectation-Maximization 
(EM) algorithm, an estimation procedure for the Bayesian HMM and infers the best sequence of methylation 
states.

(2) hummingbirdPostAdjustment: Allows researchers to place extra requirements on the selection of DMRs, 
such as the minimum length of a DMR, the minimum number of CpGs in a DMR, and the maximum distance 
(in base pairs) between any two adjacent CpGs.

(3) hummingbirdGraph: Generates the Methylation Level and Prediction graphs for the user-specified regions.

## Sample Dataset

A sample dataset "exampleHummingbird" is provided with the package as an example. 

Specifically, partial data of chromosome 29 of the large offspring syndrome (LOS) study as described in "Chen, Z. et al (2017): Global misregulation of genes largely uncoupled to DNA methylome epimutations characterizes a congenital overgrowth syndrome. Scientific Reports 7, 12667". The raw FASTQ files of the WGBS experiment from this study are publibly available at Gene Expression Omnibus with accession no. GSE93775.

The matrices m_abnormUM, m_abnormM, m_normM, m_normUM and m_pos are given as an input to the functions of the hummingbird package. They are the methylation data from the WGBS experiment. In this experiment, there are four replicates in the case (LOS) group and four replicates in the control group. However, this is just an example. The hummingbird package does not require replication in either the control or the case group.

The objects hmmbird1 and hmmbird2 are the output of the hummingbirdEM and hummingbirdPostAdjustment functions, when the aforementioned matrices are used as described in the Example section.

Below is a short presentation of the data:

```{r sampleDataset}
library(hummingbird)
data(exampleHummingbird)
```

The CpG positions:
```{r sampleDataset_pos}
m_pos[1:6,1]
```

The matrices containing the methylated and unmethylated read count data of the normal group. Each column of the matrix represents a replicate and each row represents a CpG position:
```{r sampleDataset_norm}
m_normM[1:6,1:4]
m_normUM[1:6,1:4]
```

The matrices containing the methylated and unmethylated read count data of the abnormal group. Each column of the matrix represents a replicate and each row represents a CpG position:
```{r sampleDataset_abnorm}
m_abnormM[1:6,1:4]
m_abnormUM[1:6,1:4]
```

The output of the hummingbirdEM function:
```{r sampleDataset_hmmbird_em}
str(hmmbird1)
```

The output of the hummingbirdPostAdjustment function:
```{r sampleDataset_hmmbird_postadj}
str(hmmbird2)
```


## Example

Loading the hummingbird package and the exampleHummingbird dataset (only the input matrices are required from the sample dataset):

```{r hummingbird}
library(hummingbird)
data(exampleHummingbird)
```

- hummingbirdEM: Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for Fitting the Hidden Markov Model

This function reads in methylated and unmethylated read count data, transforms it into logarithm bin-wise data, sets up initial values and implements the EM algorithm to estimate HMM parameters and find the best sequence of hidden states based on model fitting.

hmmbird1$obs is the output matrix containing the initial Direction, the Distance, the Start and End coordinates.

```{r hummingbird_em}
hmmbird1 <- hummingbirdEM(normM=m_normM, normUM=m_normUM, abnormM=m_abnormM, 
abnormUM=m_abnormUM, pos=m_pos, binSize=40)
```

- hummingbirdPostAdjustment: Post Adjustment algorithm for the output of the EM

As input to the function, the output matrix obs of the hummingbirdEM and the m_pos matrix is given.

This function adjusts HMM output such that each detected DMR has a (user-defined) minimum length, maximum gap and minimum number of CpGs in each DMR.

hmmbird2$DMRs is the output matrix containing the detected regions based on the user-defined arguments. The columns of the DMRs matrix are: Region number, Start genomic position, End genomic position, Length of region, Direction ("0" indicates no significant change, "1" indicates predicted hyper-methylation, and "2" indicates predicted hypo-methylation) and Number of CpGs.

```{r hummingbird_postAdjustment}
hmmbird2 <- hummingbirdPostAdjustment(em=hmmbird1$obs, pos=m_pos, minCpGs=10, 
minLength=100, maxGap=300)
hmmbird2$DMRs
```

- hummingbirdGraph: Generates the Methylation Level and Prediction graphs for the user-specified regions.

The Methylation Level graph is the sample averages from two comparison groups. 

The Predictions graph is the sample average difference along with predictions, where "0" indicates no significant change, "1" indicates predicted hyper-methylation, and "2" indicates predicted hypo-methylation.

In the next figures, in order to visualize the 2nd DMR, which contains the largest number of CpGs (12), its coordinates (as specified in Start/End of hmmbird2$DMRs) are entered by the user:

```{r hummingbird_graph}
hummingbirdGraph(pos=m_pos, normM=m_normM, normUM=m_normUM, abnormM=m_abnormM, 
abnormUM=m_abnormUM, dmrs=hmmbird2$DMRs, coord1=107991, coord2=108350)
```
